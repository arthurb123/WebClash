//A really simple Hello World plugin that works
//for both the client and server, the message that
//will be printed to the console can be changed by
//changing the 'message' property.
//@string message "Hello World"

console.log(message);

//As you are able to see, we specify a property called
//'message' of type string with the default value of
//'Hello World'. We can then assume that this property
//exists in the code and print it using console.log;
//As of right now the types string, number and
//boolean are supported.
