### Example<br>
An example WebClash server (EU) is available [on my webserver](http://www.arthurb.nl/projects/webclash).<br>
This example server does not get updated very often and might be running an older version.<br>
Furthermore try to force refresh (Shift+F5) the game to always have the latest files.

### Development<br>
Currently WebClash is still under development.<br>
If you find a bug or glitch, please submit an issue on this GitHub page.<br>
The development process can be followed on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/658XHkJU/webclash).

### Lynx2D<br>
