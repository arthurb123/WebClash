	       -- General --

This version of WebClash is work-in-progress,
and thus may contain bugs and glitches.
Please report found bugs and glitches at;
https://github.com/arthurb123/webclash/issues

An example project already exists, to wipe
the example project for a clean project use
the reset tool provided with the Server binary.

An account with administrator privileges should 
already exist:

user: admin
pass: password

All accounts can be found in the data folder
located in the server directory.


	     -- Customization --

Alot of things in WebClash can be customized,
the majority of the game creation/customization
will take place in the server binary.
However there are certain files that can be 
useful/important for customization;

* client/properties.js   -> Here client properties can
			    be changed, such as graphical
			    and connection settings.
* server/properties.json -> Here server properties can
			    be changed, such as server specific
			    and player starting settings.
* server/gameplay.json   -> Here gameplay properties can
			    be changed, such as day/night,
		            player death settings and aliases.


	        -- Maps --

WebClash makes use of maps created in 
Tiled (www.mapeditor.org), these maps can be
imported using the Maps interface.

Layers of maps have to be given certain
properties in the maps interface by clicking the
Edit Layers button. 
These settings determine the rendering position of 
the layer and if the layer is hovering.
The rendering position of the layer can be changed
with the Move Down and Move Up buttons.
Hovering layers live atop of all other 
entities. (players, NPCs, items, etc.)

Colliders are supported, however only in
the rectangular form.
Colliders can be created using objects (object layers)
or tile specific objects.

The custom properties available for Tiled 
objects are as follows:

[Design]

* "NPC"		      -> Spawns a NPC with the specified 
		         name. (string value)

* "item"	      -> Spawns an item with the specified
			 name, which respawns after 60
			 seconds. (string value)

* "mapDialogue"	      -> Opens up a dialogue with the
			 specified name, map dialogues
			 can be created in the Maps 
			 interface. (string value)

* "lightHotspot"      -> Creates a light hotspot in dark
		         areas with the specified radius
		         in tiles. (float value)
* "lightHotspotColor" -> Changes the color of the light
			 hotspot, transparent by default
			 and thus optional. (color value)

[Events]

* "loadMap" 	      -> Loads the map with the specified 
		         name. (string value)

* "positionX"         -> Set player position tile X.
                         (int value)
* "positionY"         -> Set player position tile Y.
		         (int value)

[Checks]
(Currently only supports design properties)

* "getVariableTrue"   -> Checks if a player variable exists
			 and is true. All other properties
	                 are only used if this check is true.
			 (string value)
* "getVariableFalse"  -> Checks if a player variable does not
			 exist or is false. All other properties
	                 are only used if this check is true.
			 (string value)


	      -- Commands --

WebClash allows chat commands based on
the player's privileges.
Admin priviliges can be granted by typing
"/op name" in the server or game chat (name 
is your player name), or by changing the 
permissions file located in the server folder.

To see the list of available commands type
"/help" in the server or game chat.


	      -- Deployment --

Because WebClash makes use of real-time UDP, it
is necessary to open up the port 9208/tcp and 
the range of ports 0-65535/upd on your server.
Also do not forget to open up the port which
is being used for the WebClash server process.
