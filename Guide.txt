	       -- General --

This version of WebClash is work-in-progress,
and thus may contain bugs and glitches.

An account with administrator privileges should 
already exist:

user: admin
pass: password


	        -- Maps --

WebClash makes use of maps created in 
Tiled (www.mapeditor.org), these maps can be
imported using the Maps interface.

The first three tile-layers of every tiled map
are considered ground, mask and second mask. 
All following layers are treated as hovering. 
This means that the layer lives atop of 
all other entities. (players, NPCs, items, etc.)

Colliders are supported, however only in
the rectangular form.
Colliders can be created using object layers
or tile specific objects.

The custom properties available for Tiled 
objects are as follows:

[Design]

* "NPC"		-> Spawns a NPC with the specified 
		   name (string value)

[Events]

* "loadMap" 	-> Loads the map with the specified 
		   name (string value)
* "positionX"   -> Set player position tile X
                   (int value)
* "positionY"   -> Set player position tile Y
		   (int value)


	      -- Commands --
