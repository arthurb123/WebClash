	       -- General --

This version of WebClash is work-in-progress,
and thus may contain bugs and glitches.

An account with administrator privileges should 
already exist:

user: admin
pass: password


	        -- Maps --

WebClash makes use of maps created in 
Tiled (www.mapeditor.org), these maps can be
imported using the Maps interface.

The first three tile-layers of every tiled map
are considered ground, mask and second mask. 
All following layers are treated as hovering. 
This means that the layer lives atop of 
all other entities. (players, NPCs, items, etc.)

Colliders are supported, however only in
the rectangular form.
Colliders can be created using object layers
or tile specific objects.

The custom properties available for Tiled 
objects are as follows:

[Design]

* "NPC"		      -> Spawns a NPC with the specified 
		         name. (string value)

* "lightHotspot"      -> Creates a light hotspot in dark
		         areas with the specified radius
		         in tiles. (float value)
* "lightHotspotColor" -> Changes the color of the light
			 hotspot, transparent by default
			 and thus optional. (color value)

[Events]

* "loadMap" 	      -> Loads the map with the specified 
		         name. (string value)

* "positionX"         -> Set player position tile X.
                         (int value)
* "positionY"         -> Set player position tile Y.
		         (int value)


	      -- Commands --

WebClash allows chat commands when the said
player has admin priviliges.
Admin priviliges can be granted in the permissions
file, located in the server folder.

To see the list of available commands type
/help in the chat.


	      -- Deployment --

Because WebClash makes use of real-time UDP, it
is necessary to open up the port 9208/tcp and 
the range of ports 0-65535/upd on your server.


	      -- Art usage --
